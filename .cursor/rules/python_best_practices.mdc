# 🐍 Python Best Practices & Poetry Enforced

## ✅ Dependency management
- **All** dependencies must be managed via Poetry:
  - `poetry add <package>`, `poetry remove <package>`
  - `poetry lock` for updates
- **Do not** use `pip install`, `pipenv`, `conda`, or any other installer script.

## 🚀 Virtual environments & execution
- Use `poetry shell` or `poetry run <command>`
- Always run scripts, tests, linters via `poetry run`

## 🧪 Testing & quality assurance
- Run tests with `pytest`, managed by Poetry.
- Use modern linting tools: `ruff`, `black`, `isort`.
- Prefer setting up pre-commit hooks for these tools.

## 🎯 Code Quality Standards
- Use dataclasses for structured data
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Avoid passing raw strings or magic values
- Use type hints for better code clarity

# 📋 SimplePlan Project Plan Summary

## 🎯 What I've Created

Based on my analysis of your repository, I've created a comprehensive project plan for **SimplePlan** - your AI-friendly project planning CLI tool. Here's what I've delivered:

### 📄 Documents Created

1. **`feature_plans/comprehensive_project_plan.md`** - Complete roadmap with 3 development phases
2. **`feature_plans/project_plan.json`** - Updated JSON plan file with actual SimplePlan steps
3. **`PROJECT_PLAN_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

## 🔍 Current State Analysis

Your project is currently in **prototype stage** with:
- ✅ Basic Poetry project structure
- ✅ JSON schema concept for project plans
- ✅ Initial documentation framework
- ❌ Demo code instead of actual implementation
- ❌ No working CLI interface

## 🚀 Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (2-3 weeks)
**Goal**: Working CLI tool for basic project management

**Key Steps**:
1. **STEP-001**: Implement `project_plan_io.py` module
2. **STEP-002**: Build CLI interface with Click
3. **STEP-003**: Add project plan CRUD operations
4. **STEP-004**: Add validation and error handling

### Phase 2: Enhanced (3-4 weeks) 
**Goal**: Advanced features and integrations

**Key Steps**:
- Step dependency management
- Multiple project support
- Export capabilities (Markdown, HTML)

### Phase 3: Advanced (4-6 weeks)
**Goal**: Full-featured platform

**Key Steps**:
- AI integration hooks
- Version control integration
- Web UI development

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

To get started with development:

1. **Add Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry add click jsonschema rich pydantic jinja2
   ```

2. **Create Project Structure**:
   ```
   src/simpleplan/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── cli.py
   ├── project_plan_io.py
   ├── models.py
   └── exporters.py
   ```

3. **Start with STEP-001**: Implement the core `project_plan_io.py` module

## 🎨 Key Features Planned

- **CLI Interface**: `simpleplan create`, `simpleplan status`, `simpleplan complete`
- **JSON Schema**: Validated project plan storage
- **Dependency Management**: Enforce step prerequisites
- **Export Options**: Markdown, HTML, status reports
- **AI Integration**: Hooks for external AI tools
- **Multi-Project**: Handle multiple concurrent projects

## 🏃‍♂️ Ready to Start?

Your project plan is now ready! The roadmap provides:
- Clear step-by-step progression
- Success criteria for each phase
- Technical architecture guidance
- Estimated timelines
